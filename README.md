ssh
=========

This is an ansible role ssh for hpc-unibe-ch.
A brief description of the role and its capabilities should go here.

Style Conventions 
-----------------

TDB

* All variabled should start with the role name (e.g. `ssh_`)
* OS-specific variables should be set in the `vars` directory and start with `__ssh_`


Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: ubelix.ssh, x: 42 }
